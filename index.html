            <h3>You Met the Dead End of Mediocrity!!!</h3>
            <p>Your product continues to be mediocre, and you are continuing to pay Sasha&#39;s salary. Because Sasha&#39;s case is not unique, and you are generally having a hard time finding and retaining good people, your company is donezo.</p>

                <h3>The "Get Well" Plan Goes Sour</h3>

                <p>In accordance with your employment lawyer’s advice, you give sasha a clear set of improvement criteria. You write it down, and e-mail her a copy. 45 days later you meet with her to assess her progress. You choose to let her go.</p>

                <p>How do you let the team know?</p>

                <button choice short-email>Send a short and terse e-mail informing the team.</button>

            <condition no-lawyer>
                <h3>Maybe that employment law in your sleep was a mistake...</h3>
                <p>Upon your conversation with Sasha, she claims that she never received negative feedback on her work. She is angry, and argues that this is the first time she has ever heard your complaints, and thus has not been afforded the opportunity for improvement. 
She claims sexism. You let her go anyways. You are not sexist!  Amidst a lawsuit, what strategies could you employ to maintain a healthy company culture, especially as it pertains to gender?</p>

            <h3>Fund Returns</h3>

            <p>As an investor in CloudAtlas, you believed that this company would be the billion-dollar unicorn that would help you return your fund. You know that CloudAtlas has been approached with a hundred-million-dollar acquisition. Are you close to returning your fund?</p>

            <button choice close>Yes! We invested in Workday!</button>
            <button choice far>Nope. We were a lead in Clinkle.</button>

        <page founder>
            <h3>Your mission</h3>

            <p>As a co-founder of CloudAtlas, this company is your baby and you’ve been working on it tirelessly for the last few years. You’ve been approached with the offer of an acquisition, and you’re trying to decide whether or not to accept it. Do you see this company mission as a topic you want to work on for the rest of your life?</p>

            <button choice yes-mission>I'm ready to give my baby up to new parents.</button>
            <button choice no-mission>I'm still having child attachment!</button>

        <page yes-mission>
            <h3>Your Personal Balance Sheet?</h3>

            <p>You may be able to scale your company’s impact but you suspect that your company’s mission will change quite a bit as a result of the acquisitions. While culture is important, financial considerations are as well. Are you financially stable with few obligations?</p>

            <button choice stable-finances>I saved every dollar since the third grade!</button>
            <button choice unstable-finances>I might have bought one too many Teslas recently?</button>

            <h3>A New Mission?</h3>
            <p>This is an opportunity for you to shift your company mission in the context of the larger firm. However, while culture is important, financial considerations are as well. Are you financially stable with few obligations?</p>

        <page stable-finances>
            <h3>But It is My Baby!</h3>

            <p>While this acquisition presents a healthy, multimillion payout for you, you feel passionately about the company mission and don’t really need the payout at the moment. In addition, you’re afraid you may not have as much control over the company mission post-acquisition. What do you decide?</p>

            <button choice accept-acquisition>Sell! (Accept Acquisition)</button>
            <button choice reject-acquisition>I am still a clingy parent! (Reject Acquisition)</button>

            <h3>Life vs. Control</h3>
            <p>This acquisition presents a healthy, multimillion payout for you that would really help you with your family and mortgage, but you also feel passionately about the company mission and are afraid you may not have as much control over it post-acquisition. What do you decide?</p>

            <button choice accept-acquisition>Sell! (Accept Acquisition)</button>

            <h3>Big Company Life</h3>
            <p>You are now a VP who occasionally sees the CEO. You are now more than set financially, but your company mission has been limited, and many of your key employees have left.</p>
