            <h3>You Met the Dead End of Mediocrity!!!</h3>
            <p>Your product continues to be mediocre, and you are continuing to pay Sasha&#39;s salary. Because Sasha&#39;s case is not unique, and you are generally having a hard time finding and retaining good people, your company is donezo.</p>

                <h3>The "Get Well" Plan Goes Sour</h3>

                <p>In accordance with your employment lawyer’s advice, you give sasha a clear set of improvement criteria. You write it down, and e-mail her a copy. 45 days later you meet with her to assess her progress. You choose to let her go.</p>

                <p>How do you let the team know?</p>

                <button choice short-email>Send a short and terse e-mail informing the team.</button>
                <button choice infer-fire>You let them gradually infer why she is absent.</button>
            </condition>

            <condition no-lawyer>
                <h3>Maybe that employment law in your sleep was a mistake...</h3>
                <p>Upon your conversation with Sasha, she claims that she never received negative feedback on her work. She is angry, and argues that this is the first time she has ever heard your complaints, and thus has not been afforded the opportunity for improvement. 
She claims sexism. You let her go anyways. You are not sexist!  Amidst a lawsuit, what strategies could you employ to maintain a healthy company culture, especially as it pertains to gender?</p>
